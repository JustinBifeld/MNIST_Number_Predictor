# MNIST_Number_Predictor
This repository creates a convolutional neural network using pytorch to perform classification on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).   The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set.  Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit 0-9.  The program can run the network on an individual image, display the image, and the networks prediction.  The network can achieve over 99% accuracy with the hyperparameters currently set, running 10 epochs with batch sizes of 100.  Below you can see a sample output of a random handwritten digit and the networks prediction.
